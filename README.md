This undergraduate senior Capstone Project aims to develop a comprehensive analysis framework using Ookla's open datasets to identify, analyze, and propose solutions for connectivity challenges in specific regions. Students will function as connectivity consultants, applying data analysis techniques to develop evidence-based recommendations that balance technical feasibility with real-world implementation constraints.
